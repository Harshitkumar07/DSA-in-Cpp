- **Reverse String**: Reversing a string in-place or recursively.  
- **Remove Duplicates**: Eliminate repeated characters while preserving order.  
- **Character Replacement**: Replace all occurrences of a character or substring efficiently.  

### 2. **Pattern Matching Algorithms**  
Algorithms to find specific patterns in strings, such as:  
- **KMP Algorithm**: Optimize substring search using prefix arrays.  
- **Rabin-Karp Algorithm**: Efficiently search substrings using hash values.  

### 3. **Substring and Subsequence Problems**  
Identify or optimize subsequences and substrings:  
- **Longest Common Substring**: Find the longest matching substring between two strings.  
- **Longest Palindromic Subsequence**: Identify palindromic patterns for dynamic programming applications.  

### 4. **Anagram and Palindrome Problems**  
Problems involving rearranging or checking string properties:  
- **Check Anagram**: Determine if two strings are anagrams of each other.  
- **Palindrome Partitioning**: Divide a string into the fewest palindromic substrings.  

### 5. **Backtracking with Strings**  
Use backtracking techniques to explore string combinations:  
- **Generate Parentheses**: Create all valid combinations of parentheses for a given number.

### 7. **Greedy Algorithms for Strings**  
Utilize greedy strategies for efficiency:  
- **Minimum Window Substring**: Find the smallest substring containing all characters of another string.  
- **Remove K Digits**: Remove specific digits to form the smallest possible number.  

### 8. **String Parsing and Tokenization**  
Break strings into smaller components for analysis:  
- **Valid IP Address**: Check whether a string represents a valid IPv4 or IPv6 address.  
- **String to Integer (Atoi)**: Convert a string into an integer while handling edge cases.  

### 9. **Other Advanced Topics**
