## Introduction

Recursion is a fundamental concept in computer science, widely used in algorithms and problem-solving. This repository is focused on using recursion in the context of **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**, showcasing its applications in solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler sub-problems.

## Why Recursion?

Recursion allows problems to be broken down into simpler sub-problems, providing elegant and concise solutions. It is commonly used in algorithms related to:

‚óæ Mathematical calculations (e.g., factorial, Fibonacci)

‚óæ Data Structures (e.g., tree traversal, backtracking)

‚óæ Optimization problems (e.g., dynamic programming, divide and conquer)

While recursion can be memory-intensive, its clear, intuitive approach often simplifies problem-solving, making it a valuable tool for any programmer.
