## Introduction

Recursion is a fundamental concept in computer science, widely used in algorithms and problem-solving. This repository is focused on using recursion in the context of **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**, showcasing its applications in solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler sub-problems.

## Why Recursion?

Recursion can often simplify the solution of a problem by reducing the code complexity. Although sometimes it can have higher memory usage, its clarity and ease of understanding for certain problems make it an essential tool in a programmer's toolkit. Problems like **factorial, Fibonacci sequence, tree traversals**, and **combinatorial problems** are classic examples where recursion shines.

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Clone the Repository**: You can clone this repository to your local machine using:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Harshitkumar07/dsa-in-cpp.git
   ```
   
2. **Navigate to Specific Problems**: The repository is organized by problem categories. Each problem is located in its respective folder with the solution in a `.cpp` file. For example:
   - `problems/factorial.cpp`
   
3. **Understand the Solution**: Each solution is well-commented for clarity. Make sure to read through the comments for a better understanding of the recursive logic used.

4. **Run the Solutions**: You can compile and run any solution using a C++ compiler:
   ```bash
   g++ filename.cpp -o output
   ./output
   ```
