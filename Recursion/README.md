## Overview

This folder contains solutions to various **data structure and algorithm (DSA)** problems implemented using **recursive methods** in C++. The focus here is on understanding the fundamentals of recursion through simple and self-contained examples, rather than platform-specific problems like Leetcode or GFG.  

Recursion is a core concept in programming that enables solving complex problems by breaking them into smaller, similar subproblems. This folder is designed for learners and developers who want to master recursion in C++ through clear explanations and practical examples.

## Structure

Each problem is implemented with the following structure:
- **Problem Statement**: A brief description of the problem or task.  
- **Recursive Approach**: Detailed explanation of the recursive method and its thought process.  
- **C++ Code**: The implementation of the recursive solution in C++.  
- **Time & Space Complexity**: A breakdown of the computational efficiency of the solution.  
- **Example Input and Output**: Sample input and output to demonstrate how the code behaves when executed.

## Why Recursion?

Recursion is a technique where a function solves a problem by calling itself with smaller inputs. It is an essential approach for problems that naturally fit into a divide-and-conquer strategy or when solving problems with overlapping subproblems.  

Key benefits of recursion:
- Simplifies code for complex problems like **tree traversals**, **combinatorics**, and **dynamic programming**.  
- Enables elegant solutions for problems involving backtracking, such as **N-Queens** or **subset generation**.  
- Plays a crucial role in mathematical computations (e.g., **factorials**, **Fibonacci series**, **power calculation**).
