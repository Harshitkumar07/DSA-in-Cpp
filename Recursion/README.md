## Overview

This folder contains solutions to various data structures and algorithm (DSA) problems using **recursive methods** in C++. 

## Structure

Each problem is implemented with the following structure:
- **Problem Statement**: A brief description of the problem.
- **Recursive Approach**: Explanation of how recursion is applied to solve the problem.
- **C++ Code**: The C++ implementation of the recursive solution.
- **Time & Space Complexity**: A breakdown of the time and space complexity for the recursive solution.
- **Example input and output**: Example of input and output that how it looks like after compilation. 

## Why Recursion?

Recursion is a powerful technique where a function calls itself to solve smaller instances of a problem. This approach is particularly useful for problems involving divide and conquer strategies, dynamic programming, and backtracking.Recursion simplifies problems like tree traversals, dynamic programming (e.g., Fibonacci, knapsack problem), and backtracking (e.g., N-Queens, subsets). It's an essential tool for solving problems where subproblems are similar to the larger problem.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the `Recursion/` folder.
3. Each file contains a problem solution. You can run the C++ code to test the solution.

## Topics Covered

Some common topics covered using recursion include:
- **Array & String Recursion** (e.g., reversing arrays, string permutations)
- **Divide and Conquer** (e.g., merge sort, quick sort)
- **Backtracking** (e.g., N-Queens, sudoku solver)
- Other types of problem will be soon updated..
