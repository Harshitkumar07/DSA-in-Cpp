**Leetcode Problem 33 :-**

Given an integer array nums and an integer val, remove all occurrences of val in nums in-place. The order of the elements may be changed. Then return the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val.
Consider the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val be k, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:
Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the elements which are not equal to val. The remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size of nums.
Return k.
    
Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3
Output: 2, nums = [2,2,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 2.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2], val = 2
Output: 5, nums = [0,1,4,0,3,_,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums containing 0, 0, 1, 3, and 4.
Note that the five elements can be returned in any order.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

**Code:-**

class Solution {
public:
    int removeElement(vector<int>& nums, int val) {
        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            if (nums[i] != val) {
                nums[ans] = nums[i];
                ans++;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
};

**Time Complexity:**
The time complexity is O(n) because we iterate through the nums array once. For each element, we check if it matches the given value val. 
If it doesn’t match, we copy it to the position indexed by ans. 
This single loop over n elements results in a time complexity of O(n), where n is the size of nums.

**Space Complexity:**
The space complexity is O(1) because we only use a fixed amount of extra space for variables (ans and i). No additional data structures are required, so the memory usage does not depend on the size of nums. 
The function modifies nums in place, which doesn’t affect the auxiliary space complexity.
