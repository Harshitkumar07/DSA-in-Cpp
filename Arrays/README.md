## Overview

This folder contains solutions to various leetcode solutions related to **Array** in C++. 

## Structure

Each problem is implemented with the following structure:
- **Problem**:Problem statement.
- **Example Input and Output**: Example input and output of the problem statement.
- **Solution**: Exact code to solve the problem.
- **C++ Code**: The C++ implementation of all solution.
- **Time & Space Complexity**: A breakdown of the time and space complexity for the recursive solution.
- **Example input and output**: Example of input and output that how it looks like after compilation. 

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the `Arrays/` folder.
3. Each file contains a problem solution. You can directly copy-paste the solution to Leetcode.
