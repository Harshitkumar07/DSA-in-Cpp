## Overview

This folder contains solutions to various leetcode solutions related to **Array** in C++. 

## Structure

Each problem is implemented with the following structure:
- **Solution**: Exact code to solve the problem.
- **C++ Code**: The C++ implementation of all solution.
- **Time & Space Complexity**: A breakdown of the time and space complexity for the recursive solution.
- **Example input and output**: Example of input and output that how it looks like after compilation. 

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the `Arrays/` folder.
3. Each file contains a problem solution. You can run the C++ code to test the solution.

## Topics Covered

Some common topics covered using recursion include:
- **Array & String Recursion** (e.g., reversing arrays, string permutations)
- **Divide and Conquer** (e.g., merge sort, quick sort)
- **Backtracking** (e.g., N-Queens, sudoku solver)
- Other types of problem will be soon updated..
